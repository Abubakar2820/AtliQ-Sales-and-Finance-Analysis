## Project Background
**AtliQ Hardware, a global manufacturer of computer hardware and accessories, specializes in producing high-quality products such as desktops, notebooks, networking equipment, and peripherals for its customers**. Despite its strong market presence, AtliQ faced challenges in fully leveraging its sales and financial data to uncover growth opportunities, enhance market performance, and sustain profitability. **In this project, I conducted a thorough analysis of AtliQ’s sales and financial data, developing detailed reports that offer actionable insights**. These insights support informed decision-making and provide a strategic foundation for driving business growth.

Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:

* Sales Trends Analysis: Examination of historical sales patterns to identify year-over-year trends in net sales, uncovering areas of growth and decline.

* Financial Performance: Analysis of key financial metrics, including Net Sales, COGS, and  Gross Margin, to assess overall profitability and cost efficiency.

* Market Performance vs. Target: Evaluation of how various markets performed against 2021 sales targets, highlighting high-growth opportunities and underperforming regions requiring strategic interventions.

* Customer Performance: Identification of top-performing customers to prioritize and low-performing ones to re-engage or optimize strategies for improved contribution.

* Product Performance: Assessment of product categories to understand their impact on overall sales and profitability, focusing on high-demand products to optimize the product mix.
