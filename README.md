![intro_picture](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/51aaee61-a52a-4b86-88ed-26a37ac3f341)

## The goal of this project is to evaluate the sales and financial performance at AtliQ Hardware in order to surface recommendations for improving revenue growth, cost management and overall profitability.

Founded in 2018, AtliQ Hardware is a rapidly growing company that manufactures computer hardware and accessories and sells them to customers across different countries. As the company expands, the need for a consolidated view of its sales and financial performance has become critical. Currently, the leadership team lacks a comprehensive report that effectively tracks key metrics such as market trends, product sales, and customer behavior, making it challenging to assess the company’s overall performance.

To address this, the Head of Operations is seeking a detailed, data-driven report that will provide valuable insights into the company’s performance. This report will support the leadership team in making informed decisions, identifying growth opportunities, and improving cost management and profitability, ultimately contributing to the company’s long-term success and operational efficiency.

The final reports delivered to the Head of Operations are as follows.
