![intro_picture](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/51aaee61-a52a-4b86-88ed-26a37ac3f341)

## Project Background
**AtliQ Hardware, a global manufacturer of computer hardware and accessories, specializes in producing high-quality products such as desktops, notebooks, networking equipment, and peripherals for its customers**. Despite its strong market presence, AtliQ faced challenges in fully leveraging its sales and financial data to uncover growth opportunities, enhance market performance, and sustain profitability. **In this project, I conducted a thorough analysis of AtliQâ€™s sales and financial data and then developed detailed reports that offer actionable insights**. These insights support informed decision-making and provide a strategic foundation for driving business growth.

Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:

* **Sales Trends Analysis**: Examination of historical sales patterns to identify year-over-year trends in net sales, uncovering areas of growth and decline.

* **Financial Performance**: Analysis of key financial metrics, including Net Sales, COGS, and  Gross Margin, to assess overall profitability and cost efficiency.

* **Market Performance vs. Target**: Evaluation of how various markets performed against 2021 sales targets, highlighting high-growth opportunities and underperforming regions requiring strategic interventions.

* **Customer Performance**: Identification of top-performing customers to prioritize and low-performing ones to re-engage or optimize strategies for improved contribution.

* **Product Performance**: Assessment of product categories to understand their impact on overall sales and profitability, focusing on high-demand products to optimize the product mix.

## Executive Summary
#### Overview Of Findings
Between 2019 and 2021, the company experienced significant growth, with net sales skyrocketing by 204% YoY in 2021, reaching $599M. However, key profitability indicators have shown declining trends. The gross margin percentage dropped from 41% in 2019 to 36% in 2021, driven by a sharp increase in total costs of goods sold (COGS), which grew by 209% YoY in 2021. While the growth in sales signals strong market demand, the decline in gross margin percentage highlights rising cost pressures and reduced profitability.

The following sections will explore the underlying factors driving these trends and identify actionable opportunities to sustain growth while improving efficiency and margins.
