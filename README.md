## Project Background
**AtliQ Hardware, a global manufacturer of computer hardware and accessories, specializes in producing high-quality products such as desktops, notebooks, networking equipment, and peripherals for its customers**. Despite its strong market presence, AtliQ faced challenges in fully leveraging its sales and financial data to uncover growth opportunities, enhance market performance, and sustain profitability. **In this project, I conducted a thorough analysis of AtliQâ€™s sales and financial data, developing detailed reports that offer actionable insights**. These insights support informed decision-making and provide a strategic foundation for driving business growth.
